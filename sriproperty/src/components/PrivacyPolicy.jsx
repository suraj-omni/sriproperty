              At sriproperty.lk, we recognize that privacy of your personal
              information is important. Here is information on what types of
              personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit

              sell your personal information to third parties.

              We also use third party advertisements on sriproperty.lk to
              support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology
              such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site,
              which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the
              Google AdSense program) information including your IP address,
              your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some
              cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used
              for geotargeting purposes (showing Colombo real estate ads to
              someone in Colombo, for example) or showing certain ads based on
              specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who
              frequents cooking sites).

              websites. This could include the inability to login to services or
              programs, such as logging into accounts.
